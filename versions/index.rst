MPF Versions
============

MPF is a work-in-progress. We release numbered versions approximately once a year. There is a "dev"
version which holds all latest the work-in-progress features.

You can find your MPF version by running `mpf --version` from the command line.

The links below explain more about how MPF version numbering works, what features are in what versions,
and a roadmap of ideas and plans for the future.

You can look at the top of the `MPF Users Google Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mpf-users>`_ to see what the latest version of MPF is.

The documentation you're reading now is for MPF v|version|. You can find documentation for
other versions via the menu in the lower left corner of this website.
