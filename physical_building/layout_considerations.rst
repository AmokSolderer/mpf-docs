What Should You Consider When Planning a Playfield Layout?
==========================================================

In general, it is a good idea if you really played pinball before.
You need to get a feel for what is rewarding as a player and then you need to
understand how that works.
For instance, where are the switches to play the first sound when you hit the
entrance of a shot?
When and how does the machine count the shot at successful?

Otherwise, you might end up with switches that when hit do absolutely nothing.
Not even a blinking light, score increment or a basic sound effect because it
does not make sense at that point.
Anyone who had played even a little pinball would've known what people were
expecting.
As you observe and play more pinball, you get a knack for what types of things
will really immerse the player, and can then incorporate them into your own games.


Some notes from people in our community (:doc:`please tell </about/contributing_to_mpf_docs>` us if you have more):

Popbumpers
----------
Make sure you surround those areas with rubber so that the ball action stays
high.
Surrounding the entire pop bumper cluster with metal will kill the fun here.

Upper Flippers
--------------
Make sure you have a feed to the upper flipper if you incorporate one.
A very reputable company managed to screw this one up on a game and it made the
upper flipper nearly pointless as you pretty much had to brick a shot just to
get a feed off of it.

Inserts
-------
Make sure each shot has dedicated inserts so that you can indicate what you
want the player to shoot.
RGB arrow inserts are great for denoting shots to the player (you can color
code them) and you donâ€™t have to put text over the arrow.
Lower inserts will generally be "mode specific".
You can look at the ramp/orbit shots on Demolition Man to get an idea for the
insert layout.
The arrows are generic, everything else is specific.

Ball Guides and Pots
--------------------

The ball should never ever ever hit metal directly unless its a lane guide.
Even then, the end of the lane guide should have a rubber post.
I knew this and still managed to screw it up on Wizard Blocks as several shots
immediately hit the lane guides or metal ramps.
It causes the whole game to play like a big clunky metal piece of garbage.
