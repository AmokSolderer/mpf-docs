Add debugging to related devices
--------------------------------

If you got problems with some switches also add ``debug: true`` to those as
it will give to more insights into the intentions of those devices.
Same will work for flippers, coils, lights, servos, steppers and more.
See :doc:`general debugging section </troubleshooting/general_debugging>`
for details.

Run MPF with verbose flag
-------------------------

See :doc:`general debugging section </troubleshooting/general_debugging>` for
details.
TLDR: run ``mpf both -t -v -V``.


Report Your Issue and Ask For Help
----------------------------------

If you cannot find the issue yourself please prepare some information about
your issue according to our
:doc:`troubleshooting guide </troubleshooting/index>` and ask in our forum.

yourself to save future users some troubles the same way others saved you
some troubles by writing this documentation.
